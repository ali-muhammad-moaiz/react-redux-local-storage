# TODO Application with React, Local Storage, and Redux Toolkit

## Introduction

This is a basic TODO application project!

The project is designed to help you understand and implement advanced concepts in React through a familiar project. Originally a basic TODO app, I've enhanced it with local storage and Redux Toolkit for state management.

## Features

- **Add, and mark tasks as done:** Creat, read, delete operations for managing tasks.
- **Local Storage:** Persist the tasks across browser sessions.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Efficient state management for the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 12.x)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository Link]
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Add a Task:** Use the input field to add a new task.
- **Delete a Task:** Click the delete button next to a task to remove it.
- **Persist Tasks:** Your tasks will be saved in local storage and reloaded when you reopen the app.

## Learning Objectives

- **React Basics:** Learn and solidify your understanding of React fundamentals.
- **State Management:** Understand and implement Redux Toolkit for managing application state.
- **Local Storage:** Persist data in the browser for a better user experience.
